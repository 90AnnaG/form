# form

It's a simple form validation (without backend yet). I'm using pure JavaScript; learning how to use SASS and BEM methodology.
I added few functions:
- check if imputs are empty, if they are - user gets a notification and input background color change to red
- check if password and password confirm are the same, if they are not - user gets a notification and input background color change to red
- reset button to clear form,
- a function that observes if user fills a required field and immediately clear a notification and red input background if it's filled
- a feature that allows user to show/hide the password input and confirm password input
